ellieborden.tech is my personal blog about software quality and testing. Its topics are primarily based on technical books and tend to emphasize theory and techniques used in various branches of testing. 

You probably won't find a lot of material on tools or automation here.  It feels like most recruiters I talk to are more concerned with test automation than testing. I like Selenium as much as the next girl, but I'm honestly tired of hearing about it.

My goal with this site is to create a free resource that provides depth, for my future-self and other testers who are bored with the average 'types of software testing' articles. I'm also using this as a sort of portfolio for hiring managers who are potentially interested in working together. <span style="font-size: .9rem;"> Seeking remote opportunities; my email is listed below. ;)</span>

## About Me

![profile picture](../assets/images/0.jpeg){:.profile-pic}

My name is Ellie Borden. I'm a software tester with a brief background in automation. I don't spend a lot of time coding these days, but when I do it's not in C#. 

My other interests include writing, jogging, hotAF peppers, radio stuff (KN4UVU), pc-gaming, and leg day. I spend the majority of my time reading -- mostly nonfiction, but the occasional Fantasy or Thriller too.

I'm based in Grand Rapids, Michigan but am traveling the US with my lover for his work. He's the lime to my Malibu and cranberry.
